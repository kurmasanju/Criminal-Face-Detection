# Criminal-Face-Detection
INTRODUCTION:
Criminal face detection using machine learning leverages advanced computer vision techniques to automatically identify and match faces from surveillance footage or image databases against a pre-trained model of known offenders.
This system aims to enhance public safety by enabling real-time detection and recognition of individuals with criminal records. By using techniques such as face detection, facial feature extraction, and classification algorithms, the model can accurately distinguish between known criminals and non-criminals. The integration of this technology with existing surveillance systems can significantly improve law enforcement capabilities, reduce manual efforts, and speed up criminal investigations.
The project typically involves the use of libraries such as OpenCV for face detection, and machine learning models like LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram), Haar Cascades, or deep learning-based models (e.g., CNNs) for recognition. The system can be trained using a dataset of labeled images, and then deployed for real-time or offline face recognition tasks.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 In the current digital era, public safety and crime prevention are critical challenges for law enforcement agencies. Traditional manual methods of identifying criminals from surveillance footage or images are timeconsuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive. There is a pressing need for an intelligent, automated system that can rapidly and accurately detect and recognize criminal faces from a database to assist in crime detection and investigation.This project aims to develop a machine learning-based criminal face detection system that can analyze facial images, compare them with a pre-existing criminal database, and accurately identify individuals with a history of criminal activity. The system will utilize computer vision techniques and machine learning models to extract facial features and perform real-time or image-based recognition.

 ALGORITHM :
  • Algorithm Selection
 LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) is used for face recognition. It’s simple, fast, and works well with small          
datasets and different lighting conditions.
 • Data Input
 Grayscale face images
 Pixel intensity and texture patterns.
 • Training Process
 LBP Creation: Compare each pixel with its neighbors to form a binary pattern.
 Histogram Creation: Divide the image into regions and compute histograms of LBP values.
 Histogram Concatenation: Combine all histograms into a single feature vector.
 • Prediction Process
 Extract LBP features from a new image
 Compare with stored feature vectors
 Use distance measure to find the best match

FUTURE SCOPE:
 The criminal face detection system has significant potential for future enhancements that can greatly improve its accuracy, efficiency, and real-world applicability. One major advancement would be the integration of deep learning techniques, such as FaceNet or VGGFace, to replace traditional methods like LBPH for more precise facial recognition, even under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Additionally, the system can be extended to support real-time surveillance by integrating it with CCTV networks, enabling continuous monitoring and immediate alerts in high-security areas like airports and public places.
  Real-Time CCTV Surveillance:Integrate with live CCTV systems to continuously monitor public spaces and instantly detect known criminals in real-time.
  Mobile App Development:Create a mobile app for law enforcement to perform on-the-spot face recognition using smartphone cameras during field operations.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CONCLUSION:
 The proposed criminal detection system integrates face recognition with real-time video processing and database management, using the LBPH algorithm for efficiency and accuracy. It achieves 85% accuracy in real-world conditions, with minimal false positives and negatives. The modular design allows scalability, while opensource libraries ensure cost-effectiveness. Challenges include low lighting, occlusions, and pose variations, With further optimization, the system can enhance large-scale surveillance, aiding law enforcement and security efforts.
